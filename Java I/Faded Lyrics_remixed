you were the shadow to my light 
did you feel us 
another star 
you fly away 
afraid our aim is out of sight 
wanna see us 
alight 
 
where are you now 
where are you now 
where are you now 
was it all in my fantasy 
where are you now 
were you only imaginary 
 
where are you now 
atlantis 
under the sea 
under the sea 
where are you now 
another dream 
the monster's running wild inside of me 
i'm flying 
i'm flying 
so lost i'm flying 
i'm flying 
so lost i'm flying 
 
these shallow waters never met what i needed 
i'm letting go a deeper dive 
eternal silence of the sea i'm breathing 
alive 
 
where are you now 
where are you now 
under the bright but flying lights 
you've set my heart on fire 
where are you now 
where are you now 
 
where are you now 
atlantis 
under the sea 
under the sea 
where are you now 
another dream 
the monster's running wild inside of me 
i'm flying 
i'm flying 
so lost i'm flying 
i'm flying 
so lost i'm flying
